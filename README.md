## Dynamic Label Graph Matching for Unsupervised Video Re-Identification

Demo code for "Dynamic Label Graph Matching for Unsupervised Video Re-Identification" in ICCV 2017.





We revised the evaluation proctocal for the IDE on MARS dataset. In previous version, due to file traverse problem, which leads a different evaluation proctol, we achieve an extremely high performance compared with other baselines (Unsupervised rank-1 65.2%, and supervised 75.8). We re-evaluate our perfomance under standard settings, the rank-1 is 36.8% for our unsupervised method, and the supervised upper bound is 56.2%.
